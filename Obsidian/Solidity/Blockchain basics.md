Imagine **blockchain** as a digital, shared notebook that's copied and distributed across thousands of computers. This notebook, or **ledger**, is incredibly secure because it's not controlled by a single person or company. Instead of pages, it uses **blocks** to record information, and each new block is cryptographically linked to the one before it, creating an unbreakable chain

## How Blockchain Works
- **Transactions are batched into a "block."** When a new transaction happens (like sending cryptocurrency or an agreement being made), it's put into a group with other recent transactions.
- **The block is verified by nodes.** These are the individual computers that are part of the blockchain network. They use a **consensus mechanism** (a set of rules) to verify the transactions in the new block.
- **The verified block is added to the chain.** Once a majority of nodes agree the transactions are valid, the new block is added to the end of the chain. This new block now contains a unique identifier (called a cryptographic hash) that links it to the previous block.
- **The ledger is updated for everyone.** Because every node has a copy of the notebook, the new, updated chain is sent to all of them, ensuring everyone has the same, tamper-proof record of all transactions.
  This process makes the blockchain **decentralized** (no central authority), **immutable** (cannot be changed), and **transparent** (everyone can see the record).

## Smart Contracts and the Blockchain
A **smart contract** is like a [self-executing program] that lives inside this digital notebook. It's a set of "if/then" rules written directly into the code.

Here's the connection:
- You don't need a middleman (like a bank or lawyer) to enforce the rules.
- The terms of the contract are written in code and uploaded to the blockchain
- The blockchain's network of **nodes** then verifies and executes the contract automatically when the pre-defined conditions are met.
**Analogy:** A smart contract is a vending machine. You put in the correct amount of money (the "if" condition), and the machine automatically dispenses the soda (the "then" action). The blockchain is the network of vending machines all over the world, each with a secure, transparent record of every soda sold.

## Nodes and Ethereum
**Nodes** are the computers that run the blockchain software. They are the backbone of the network, performing two main jobs:
- They store a complete copy of the blockchain ledger.
- They **verify and validate** new transactions and blocks, ensuring that the rules of the network are followed.
By having thousands of nodes around the world, the blockchain stays decentralized and secure. If one node goes offline, the network keeps running because there are thousands of others to take its place.

## Ethereum
**Ethereum** is a specific type of blockchain platform. While the Bitcoin blockchain was created mainly for one purpose—to be a digital currency—Ethereum was designed to be a programmable blockchain. It's like a decentralized, global computer.

- **Ethereum's main innovation is its support for smart contracts.** It allows developers to write and deploy a wide range of applications (called decentralized applications) on its network.
 - The native currency of Ethereum is called **ether (ETH)**. It's used as "gas" to pay for the computational power needed to run transactions and smart contracts on the network. Think of it as the fuel for the Ethereum computer.
